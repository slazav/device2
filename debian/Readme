This directory contains information for building a Debian package.
Changelog file is missing because I convert it from spec-file during build.
Other files are decribed in
https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dreq.en.html
https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dother.en.html

I use alt2deb scripts (see somewhere in my github for building)
for converting changelog and building.
