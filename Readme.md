# Device2

## Overview

This is a client-server system for accessing devices and programs in
experimental setups. Previous version was a tcl library (
https://github.com/slazav/tcl-device ) with a few annoying limitations.

There is a server which work with "devices". They can be physical devices
connected in various ways or programs with special interface. Each device
has a unique name, which is listed in the server configuration file.
Server knows how to open a device, send it a message and receive answer.

Clients can connect to the server using HTTP protocol and send messages to
devices. This architecture has many advantages comparing to direct connections
between clients and devices:

* Clients know nothing about device connection details, they should use
only device name to access it. All low-level connection parameters (e.g.
serial port configuration) are managed by the server.

* Multiple clients can access a single device without collisions. All
needed lockings are done by the server. A client can also lock a device for
single use, preventing others from accessing it.

* A device is opened on demand, then the fist client start using it and closed
then all users disconnected. Client should keep a permanent connection
to the server if it wants to use a device without closing/opening it.

* Any client can monitor all messages for any device.

* Remote access to devices can be easily implemented in this system by
either making a tunnel for HTTP connections, or by attaching the
remote client program, `device_c` to the local server as a device.

The server support devices connected via linux-gpib and usbtmc kernel
drivers; serial and network devices (including LXI); programs with SPP
interface.

## Server

### HTTP communication with the server

Clients communicate with the server using GET requests of HTTP protocol.
URLs with up to three components are used: `<action>/<device>/<message>`.
(Note that symbol `/` is not allowed in device names). For example, a
request to `http://<server>:<port>/ask/generator/FREQ?`" sends phrase
`FREQ?` to the device `generator` and returns answer.

On success a response with code 200 and answer of the device in the
message body is returned. On error a response with code 400 is returned.
Error description is written in `Error` header and in the message body.

The server does not know what it sends to a device and what answer is
expected, it just provides connection. For the next layer see DeviceRole
library. It defines certain "roles" for devices with common high-level
commands (e.g. "generator" role has a "set frequency" command).

Supported actions:

* `ask/<device>/<message>` -- Send message to a device, return answer.

* `devices` or `list` -- Show list of all known devices.

* `info/<device>` -- Print information about a device.

* `reload` -- Reload device configuration. If case of errors in the file
old configuration is kept.

* `ping` -- Check connection to the server. Returns nothing.

* `get_time` -- Get system time (unix seconds with microsecond precision)

* `use/<device>` -- Use a device in this connection. Usually a device is
opened (if it is not opened yet) on demand, then `ask` action is called.
This action can be used to open and check the device before sending any
message to it (e.g. to process errors separately).

* `release/<device>` -- Notify the server that this device is not going
to be used by this connection anymore. Device is closed if no other
connections use it. Normally devices are closed
when session is ended and no other sessions are using the device.

* `log_start/<device>` -- Any user can see all communications of every device.
To do it one should start with `log_start` action. The buffer of size
1024 lines is created for this connection, all messages send to the
device, all answers and errors received will be written to the buffer
(with "<<", ">>", and "EE" prefixes). If the buffer already exists it will
be cleared.

* `log_finish/<device>` -- Stop logging, delete the log buffer for this
connection.

* `log_get/<device>` -- Get contents of the log buffer, clear it. If logging
is stopped return error.

* `lock/<device>` -- Lock the device for single use. Normally no locking
is needed, many clients can communicate with the device without collisions.
But in some cases one may want to lock the device to prevent others from
using it. This is done by the `lock` action, only if
the device has no other users.

* `unlock/<device>` -- Unlock the device previously locked with the `lock`
command.

* `set_conn_name/<name>` -- Set connection name. Each connection to the
server has a unique number and unique text name (by default it is
"#<conn_number>"). Client can change the name using this function. Name
set by user can not start with "#". If name is empty, the default value
"#<conn_number>" is set. If name already belongs to another connection error
occures. This feature can be used to detect another instances of the same
program.

* `get_conn_name` -- Get connection name.

* `list_conn_names` -- List all connections.

* `release_all` -- Release (and unlock) all devices, reset connection name
to default value.

There are two problems with locks and unique connection names (and
generally with session handling):

* If server is restarted, connections are reopened and clients do not
know about it. Locks and connection names will be lost in this situation.
It is recommended to update locks and names regularly, e.g. at the
beginning of each measurement cycle.

* Server can keep the connection when the client program already finished.
Locks and connection name are still there, and can affect the client if
it will  restart connection (e.g if the program is restarted). It is
recommended to run `release_all` action to unlocked devices and reset
connection name to default value before disconnecting.

### Starting the server

Usage:
* `device_d <options>`

Options:

* `-C, --cfgfile <arg>` -- Server configuration file (default: `/etc/device/device_d.cfg`).
* `-D, --devfile <arg>` -- Device list file (default: `/etc/device/devices.cfg`).
* `-a, --addr <arg>`    -- IP address to listen. Use "*" to listen everywhere (default: `127.0.0.1`).
* `-p, --port <arg>`    -- TCP port for connections (default: `8082`).
* `-f, --dofork`        -- Do fork and run as a daemon.
* `-S, --stop`          -- Stop running daemon (found by pid-file).
* `-R, --reload`        -- Reload configuration of running daemon (found by pid-file).
* `-U, --user <arg>`    -- Run as user (default: empty, do not switch user).
* `-v, --verbose <arg>` -- Verbosity level (default: 1):
  - 0 - write nothing;
  - 1 - write some information on server start/stop;
  - 2 - write about opening/closing connections and devices;
  - 3 - write all messages sent to devices and received from them.
* `-l, --logfile <arg>` -- Log file, "-" for stdout.
  (default: `/var/log/device_d.log` in daemon mode, "-" in console mode.
* `-P, --pidfile <arg>` -- Pid file (default: `/var/run/device_d.pid`)
* `--test`              -- Test mode with connection number limited to 1.
* `-h, --help`          -- Print help message and exit.
* `--pod`               -- Print help message in POD format and exit.

Configuration file: Server configuration file can be used to override
default values for some of the command-line options. Following parameters
can be set in the configuration file: `addr`, `port`, `logfile`,
`pidfile`, `devfile`, `user`, `verbose`

The file contains one line per parameter. Empty lines and comments (starting
with `#`) are allowed. A few lines can be joined by adding symbol `\`
before end of line. Words can be quoted by single or double quotes.
Special symbols (`#`, `\`, quotes) can be typed by adding `\` in front of
them. Case of characters is important. Each non-empty, non-comment line
should have the form:
```
<parameter name> <parameter value>
```

Signal handling: server exits on SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGQUIT signals. Device
list is re-read on SIGHUP signal. If `device_d` program is called with
`--stop`/`--reload` parameter it will send SIGTERM/SIGHUP to a running
server (found by pid-file). Reloading can be also done by any client
with `reload` action.

### Device list file

Default location of the device configuration file is
`/etc/device2/devices.cfg` It can be changed with server command-line
option `-D` or in the server configuration file.

The file contains one line per device. Empty lines and comments (starting
with `#`) are allowed. A few lines can be joined by adding symbol `\`
before end of line. Words can be quoted by single or double quotes.
Special symbols (`#`, `\`, quotes) can be typed by adding `\` in front of
them. Case of characters is important. Each non-empty, non-comment line
should have the form:
```
<device name> <driver name> [-<parameter> <value> ...]
```

Device name should be non-empty and should not contain ` `, `\n`, `\t`,
`\` and `/` characters.

Parameters are driver-specific.

If the file contains errors server prints error message in the log and
keep old configuration (if any). If after starting the server you see no
devices in the `list` action output, try to do `reload` and see error
message.

Usage:
* `device_c [<options>] ask <dev> <msg> ...` -- send message to the device, print answer
* `device_c [<options>] use_dev <dev>`   -- SPP interface to a device
* `device_c [<options>] use_srv`         -- SPP interface to the server
* `device_c [<options>] (list|devices)`  -- print list of available devices
* `device_c [<options>] info <dev>`      -- print information about device
* `device_c [<options>] reload`          -- reload device configuration
* `device_c [<options>] monitor <dev>`   -- monitor all communication of the device
* `device_c [<options>] ping`            -- check if the server is working
* `device_c [<options>] get_time`        -- get server system time
* `device_c [<options>] get_srv`         -- get server address

Options:
* `-s, --server <arg>` -- Server (default: localhost).
* `-p, --port <arg>`   -- Port (default: 8082).
* `-v, --via <arg>`    -- Connect to the server through a tunnel.
                          Argument: name of the gateway.
* `--via_cmd <arg>`    -- Specify command template for making the tunnel, with $L, $R, $H,
                          and $G for local port, remote port, remote host and gateway.
                          Default: /usr/bin/ssh -f -L \"$L\":\"$H\":\"$R\" \"$G\" sleep 20
* `-l, --lock`         -- Lock the device (only for `use_dev` action).
* `-h, --help`         -- Print help message and exit.
* `--pod`              -- Print help message in POD format and exit.

Client configuration file (`/etc/device/device_c.cfg`) is similar to the
server one.  Following parameters can be set in the configuration file:
`server`, `port`, `via`, `via_cmd`.


### Examples

Get device list. There are two devices available:
```
$ device_c list
graphene
test
```

Get information about a device. The device uses `spp` driver which runs program `graphene -i`
and talks with it using SPP interface. It is not used by anybody (and thus closed).
```
$ device_c info graphene
Device: graphene
Driver: spp
Driver arguments:
  -prog: graphene -i
Device is closed
Number of users: 0
```

Send message to a device and get answer. In this case we send `get_time` command to
the `graphene` device:
```
$ device_c ask graphene get_time
1601282446.214037
```

Send message to a device and get answer. Create a database with FLOAT values
using the `graphene` device:
```
$ device_c ask graphene create new_db FLOAT "my new database"
1601282446.214037
```

The server also has `get_time` action to get system time on the server:
```
$ device_c get_time
1601284005.581721
```

Use a device for multiple queries, without reopening it. In this case SPP protocol
is used: each message is followed by `#OK` or `#Error <message>` line.
Every input line is sent to the device as-is, answer is returned.

```
$ device_c use_dev graphene
#SPP001
Server: http://localhost:8082
Device: graphene
#OK
bad_command
#Error: Unknown command: bad_command
get_time 0
#Error: too many parameters
get_time
1601284282.200903
#OK
```

Use the server for multiple queries. In this mode you have access to all
server actions and can work with multiple devices. Every input line is
split into three words: `action`, `device`, and `message`. The
`read_words` library ( https://github.com/slazav/mapsoft2-libs/tree/master/read_words ) is used
to enable quotes, escape characters, multiline input etc. For example, if
you want to use spaces in the message, quote it.

```
$ device_c use_srv
#SPP001
Server: http://localhost:8082
#OK
ask graphene get_time
1601284389.596303
#OK
list
graphene
test

#OK
info graphene
Device: graphene
Driver: spp
Driver arguments:
  -prog: graphene -i
Device is open
Number of users: 1
You are currently using the device

#OK
```

### Remote use and how to crash the server

There are two ways how to configure remote access to your devices. First,
you can connect to the remote server by HTTP protocol. Note that device
server does not have any security features, and it's not safe to allow
connections from outside. But it should be safe to make an ssh tunnel to
the remote server. This can be done with -via parameter of `device_c`
command.

Other option is to use external devices connected to the local server.
The `device_c` program implements SPP protocol when using in `use_dev`
and `use_srv` modes. Thus it can be used as a device. If you have device
servers running on both computers and want to access remote device
`mydev`, just write in the local configuration something like this:
```
mydev   spp -prog "ssh comp2 device_c use_dev mydev"
```

This approach allows you to mix local and remote devices on your computer
and access them through the local server. Note that in this configuration
you should have timeouts of the spp driver larger then timeouts of the
device's driver. Currently default read/open timeouts are:
10s/20s for spp, 3s/10s for gpib, 5s for serial, usbtmc, and net drivers.

Now it should be obvious how to crash the server: connect a device to itself!
```
mydev   spp -prog "device_c use_dev mydev"
```

### TCL library

There is a TCL library Device2 for working with the server.

"New" interface:

* `Device2:addr` -- variable with the server address. When library is loading
it is updated by running `device_c get_srv` and thus syncronized with
device_c configuration file (TODO: what about -via setting?).

* `Device2:get <action> <device> <msg> ...` -- the most general function
for communicating with the server. All extra arguments are joined with `<msg>`.

* `Device2:ask <dev> <msg>`
* `Device2:list`
* `Device2:reload`
* `Device2:ping`
* `Device2:get_time`
* `Device2:info <dev>`
* `Device2:use <dev>`
* `Device2:release <dev>`
* `Device2:lock <dev>`
* `Device2:unlock <dev>`
* `Device2:log_start <dev>`
* `Device2:log_finish <dev>`
* `Device2:log_get <dev>` -- syntactic sugar for all actions

"Old" interface is almost compatable with Device library (https://github.com/slazav/tcl-device).
For each device `itcl` object with `cmd`, `lock`, `unlock` methods can be created. Methods
`read` and `write` are missing (they were not widely used and I want to get rid of them).
```
Device <name>
<name> cmd *IDN?
DeviceDelete <name>
```

For example, DeviceRole library can be switched to Device2 just by
replacing `package use Device` by `package use Device2`.
